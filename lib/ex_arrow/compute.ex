defmodule ExArrow.Compute do
  @moduledoc """
  Arrow compute kernels: filter rows, project (select) columns, and sort — all
  entirely in native memory.

  Column buffers are never copied into BEAM terms.  Every function takes one or
  more `ExArrow.RecordBatch` handles and returns a new handle.  The result can
  be passed directly to `ExArrow.IPC.Writer`, `ExArrow.Flight.Client.do_put/4`,
  or further compute operations without any intermediate serialisation.

  ## Quick example

  Given a batch from an ADBC query or IPC file:

      # Select only the columns you need
      {:ok, slim}  = ExArrow.Compute.project(batch, ["user_id", "score"])

      # Sort by score descending
      {:ok, sorted} = ExArrow.Compute.sort(slim, "score", ascending: false)

  ## Building a boolean predicate for `filter/2`

  `filter/2` expects the **first column** of a second record batch to be a
  boolean Arrow array.  The most common source is a query result that already
  contains a boolean column:

      # e.g. "SELECT id, score, is_active FROM users"
      {:ok, stream}  = ExArrow.ADBC.Statement.execute(stmt)
      batch          = ExArrow.Stream.next(stream)

      # Project the boolean column into its own batch
      {:ok, mask}     = ExArrow.Compute.project(batch, ["is_active"])
      {:ok, filtered} = ExArrow.Compute.filter(batch, mask)

  You can also write a Parquet/IPC file that contains a pre-computed boolean
  column and read it back as the predicate.

  @doc """
  Filter rows from `batch` using the first (boolean) column of `predicate_batch`.

  `predicate_batch` must have at least one column and its first column must be
  a boolean Arrow array with the same row count as `batch`.  Rows where the
  predicate is `true` are kept; rows where it is `false` or `null` are dropped.

  Returns `{:ok, filtered_batch}` or `{:error, message}`.

  ## Example

      # Keep only rows where "is_active" is true.
      # batch has columns [id, score, is_active]; extract the bool column first.
      {:ok, mask}     = ExArrow.Compute.project(batch, ["is_active"])
      {:ok, filtered} = ExArrow.Compute.filter(batch, mask)
      # filtered has the same columns as batch but only the rows where is_active = true

  Project (select) a subset of columns from `batch` by name.

  Columns appear in the result in the order given by `column_names`.  Requesting
  a name that does not exist returns `{:error, "column 'x' not found"}`.

  Returns `{:ok, projected_batch}` or `{:error, message}`.

  ## Examples

      # Select two columns; result schema has only [user_id, score]
      {:ok, slim} = ExArrow.Compute.project(batch, ["user_id", "score"])

      # Reorder: result schema is [score, user_id]

  Sort `batch` by `column_name`.

  All columns in the batch are reordered together — the sort is applied to the
  full batch, not just the key column.  Nulls are always placed first regardless
  of sort direction.

  ## Options

    * `:ascending` — `true` (default) for A→Z / small→large order;
      `false` for descending.

  Returns `{:ok, sorted_batch}` or `{:error, message}`.

  ## Examples

      # Sort by score, lowest first (default)
      {:ok, sorted} = ExArrow.Compute.sort(batch, "score")

      # Sort by score, highest first
