## Elixir Forum (Announcements)

**Title:** ExArrow 0.1.0 – Apache Arrow for the BEAM (IPC, Flight, ADBC)

**Body:**

ExArrow 0.1.0 is now on Hex. It adds Apache Arrow support for Elixir/OTP: IPC (stream and file read/write), Arrow Flight (gRPC client and echo server), and ADBC (Arrow Database Connectivity) so you can run SQL and get Arrow result streams from drivers like SQLite and PostgreSQL.

Data stays in native Rust/Arrow buffers; Elixir uses opaque handles (Schema, RecordBatch, Stream). No Rust required for normal use: precompiled NIFs are shipped for Linux, macOS, and Windows via RustlerPrecompiled.

Use it for: ingesting Arrow IPC from pipelines, querying databases via ADBC and re-exporting to IPC or Flight, connecting to Flight-compatible services (e.g. Dremio, InfluxDB IOx), and interchanging Arrow files with Explorer, Python, or R.

Requirements: Elixir ~> 1.18, OTP 26+.

## Reddit — r/elixir

**Title:** ExArrow 0.1.0 – Apache Arrow on the BEAM (IPC, Flight, ADBC)

**Body:**

First release of ExArrow is on Hex. It brings Apache Arrow to Elixir: read/write IPC streams and files, Arrow Flight client and echo server (gRPC), and ADBC so you can run SQL and get Arrow result batches from SQLite, Postgres, etc. Data lives in native buffers; Elixir holds handles. Precompiled NIFs for Linux, macOS, and Windows so you don’t need Rust.

Good fit for data pipelines, ETL, talking to Flight services (Dremio, InfluxDB IOx), and swapping Arrow data with Explorer or Python/R. Elixir ~> 1.18, OTP 26+.
