# ExArrow 0.1.0 — Release notes

**Release date:** 2026-02-25  
**Package:** [Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_arrow) | **Docs:** [hexdocs.pm/ex_arrow](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_arrow) | **Source:** [GitHub](https://github.com/thanos/ex_arrow)

## Summary

ExArrow 0.1.0 is the first public release. It brings Apache Arrow support to the BEAM: IPC (stream and file), Arrow Flight (client and server), and ADBC (Arrow Database Connectivity). Data stays in native Rust/Arrow buffers; Elixir uses opaque handles. Precompiled NIFs are provided for Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (x86_64, arm64), and Windows (x86_64), so no Rust toolchain is required for normal use.

**Requirements:** Elixir ~> 1.18, OTP 26+

## What's included

**IPC (Inter-Process Communication)**  
- Read/write Arrow stream format from binary or file.  
- Random-access file format: open by path or binary, read schema, batch count, and any batch by index.  
- Same `ExArrow.Stream` and `ExArrow.Schema` / `ExArrow.RecordBatch` handles as Flight and ADBC.

**Arrow Flight**  
- gRPC client: connect, do_put, do_get, list_flights, get_flight_info, get_schema, list_actions, do_action.  
- Built-in echo server for testing or simple services.  
- Plaintext HTTP/2 only in this release (TLS planned). Compatible with Dremio, InfluxDB IOx, and custom Flight servers.

**ADBC**  
- Open database by driver path or driver name (e.g. SQLite, PostgreSQL). Execute SQL and get an Arrow result stream.  
- Metadata APIs where the driver supports them: get_table_types, get_table_schema, get_objects.  
- Statement.bind for parameter binding where supported.

**Memory and scheduling**  
- Arrow data lives in native memory; no BEAM heap copy by default.  
- Long-running NIF work uses dirty schedulers so the BEAM is not blocked.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:ex_arrow, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Then `mix deps.get` and `mix compile`. The precompiled NIF is downloaded from GitHub releases. To build from source (e.g. unsupported platform), set `EX_ARROW_BUILD=1` and have Rust installed.
